After Data cleaning we will do the following

Predictive Modelling

For forecasting the inter-city electricity demand influenced by climate change variables, the following modeling approaches will be explored and compared

Statistical Regression Models(your choice which is good) - Including multiple linear regression and polynomial regression to capture linear and non-linear relationships.

Time-Series Forecasting Models - Models such as ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average), SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA), and Exponential Smoothing methods to explicitly account for time dependencies.

Machine Learning Models - Advanced techniques including Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Machines (XGBoost, LightGBM), and Support Vector Regression (SVR).

Neural Networks - Deployment of LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks specifically designed for sequence prediction tasks.

Model Evaluation and Selection

To determine the most effective predictive model, the following evaluation strategies will be employed

Cross-validation - Applying K-fold or time-series cross-validation to prevent overfitting and assess model generalizability.

Performance Metrics - Utilizing metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and R-squared for regression-based models.

Diagnostic Plots - Residual plots and prediction versus actual plots to visually assess model fit.

The best-performing model(s) will be selected based on these criteria, emphasizing predictive accuracy, robustness, and interpretability.

Sensitivity and Scenario Analysis

Finally, sensitivity analysis will be conducted by varying the climate scenarios to evaluate how shifts in temperature and extreme weather patterns may influence electricity demand forecasts, thus supporting robust decision-making for future energy policies and planning in New South Wales.
